# Loan Application Validation Platform

Capstone II project at Florida International University evolving a loan validation workflow that combines document authenticity checks with automated spam email detection to safeguard financial institutions and borrowers.

## Project Purpose

- Streamline the screening of loan applications through staged validation.
- Verify supporting documentation to flag incomplete or tampered files.
- Detect spam or fraudulent communications tied to the application pipeline.
- Produce transparent artifacts and metrics for auditors and stakeholders.

## Core Capabilities

- Document Verification Pipeline: ingest application packets, perform metadata validation, and surface exceptions for manual review (implementation in progress).
- Spam Email Detection: classify emails related to loan processing using recurrent neural network models (currently implemented in the notebook workflow).

## Repository Structure

- `notebooks/spam-detection-using-rnn-lstm-gru.ipynb` – end-to-end experimentation notebook for the spam detection module.
- `data/spam.csv` – SMS/email dataset featuring `Category` and `Message` fields from the SMS Spam Collection (UCI/Kaggle derivative).
- `models/` – saved TensorFlow/Keras weights (`*.h5`) generated by the notebook.
- `requirements.txt` – Python dependencies for both modules.
- Additional document verification assets will be added as development progresses.

## Environment Setup

Use a Python 3.10+ environment (virtualenv, venv, or conda) before installing dependencies.

### Windows (PowerShell)
```powershell
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### macOS / Linux
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Working with the Spam Detection Module

1. Activate your environment and install the requirements.
2. Launch Jupyter: `jupyter notebook` (or `jupyter lab`).
3. Open `notebooks/spam-detection-using-rnn-lstm-gru.ipynb`.
4. Run all cells to preprocess data, train Simple RNN, LSTM, and GRU models, visualize performance, and export the weights.

> Tip: The notebook trains each network for 10 epochs with a batch size of 64. Adjust these hyperparameters to explore different performance trade-offs or evaluation strategies.
